# hostednetwork

GUI program to toggle netsh

A program usable for toggling the Windows Hosted network. Uses the netsh functionality. The hosted network feature has to be preconfigured in order for this program to work. Essentially runs "netsh wlan start hostednetwork" and "netsh wlan stop hostednetwork" in the command line.
<br><br>Use this link to learn about the netsh tool: <br>http://www.practicallynetworked.com/networking/create_a%20virtual_wireless_router_with_windows.htm
<br><br>Makes it possible to create a hosted network in most recent versions of Windows.
<br>I stopped the development of this program for I am no longer a windows user. You can change the source yourself.
